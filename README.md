Figure 1 is generated using "tanh approximation graph"

Figure 2(a) is generated using "HAWT full code"
Figure 2(b) is generated usign "VAWT full code". - This has also been modified from the HAWT to use the analytical derivative instead of the centered difference approach

"A_VAWT_Calculation" calculates the normalised forcing amplitude (A_VAWT)
